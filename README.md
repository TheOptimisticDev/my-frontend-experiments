# My Frontend Experiments

A collection of projects completed during my journey of learning frontend development. These projects showcase my progress in building responsive, interactive websites and user interfaces. The projects include implementations of core web technologies, as well as libraries and frameworks used to enhance functionality and streamline development.

## Technologies Used

These projects cover a variety of frontend technologies, including:

- **HTML5 & CSS3** â€“ Structuring and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** â€“ Implementing dynamic behavior and interactivity.
- **React.js** â€“ Building reusable UI components and managing state efficiently.
- **Tailwind CSS / Bootstrap** â€“ Streamlining styling and responsiveness.
- **APIs & Fetch** â€“ Integrating third-party data sources.
- **Git & GitHub** â€“ Version control and project collaboration.

## Projects Included

Here are some of the key projects in this repository:

1. **Responsive Landing Page** â€“ A fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Flexbox/Grid.
2. **Interactive To-Do List** â€“ A simple task manager with local storage.
3. **Weather App** â€“ Fetching real-time weather data from an API.
4. **E-commerce Product Page** â€“ Implementing a product showcase with a shopping cart feature.
5. **React Dashboard** â€“ A simple admin panel with data visualization.

## How to Use

To explore the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-frontend-experiments.git

2. cd project-folder-name
